For IT, the delivery, management and security of corporate desktops, applications and data is an exceedingly complex challenge. Our End-User Computing team is building the next generation platform for enabling the mobile, modern workforce. The Horizon family of products was developed around the vision that users now need a virtual workspace - a central hub for accessing all their desktops, business applications, services and files. Windows desktops have been a mainstay of the enterprise for 25 years, but a fundamental shift is now underway affecting the way enterprise customers access desktops, applications, and data. This shift is driven by two large-scale trends: cloud computing, and the emergence of personal Internet-connected devices to replace PCs. Desktops, apps, and data should be accessible from any device, anywhere, transparently. VMware Horizon (View), as the leading implementation of Virtual Desktop Infrastructure, is a key enabler for the desktop of the future as well as application delivery. VMware View is the solution that centralizes desktops in the datacenter and makes them available remotely from multiple endpoint devices. VMware Horizon DaaS is a SaaS solution for delivering virtual desktop remotely. The Horizon DaaS engineering team is developing a software platform that enables enterprises to consume desktops from the cloud in an as-a-service model.

This greatly reduces the time needed for customer issues to get fixed and get changes applied.\" Stefan De Kooter, Network Engineer, Proxsys \"Appliance-based products weren't meeting our needs, and as we evaluated alternatives, web application firewalling was our number-one consideration. We were pleasantly surprised by Avi iWAF's simple deployment, impressive ease-of-use, and intelligent security analytics, as well as the responsiveness of the Avi team.\" Joris Vuffray, Head of Network and System Mgmt, ., SWISSLOS \"We evaluated traditional and open source load balancers but they didn't meet our agility, flexibility, and performance expectations.
